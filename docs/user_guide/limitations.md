# Limitations

The plugin is currently marked as experimental.

The aim is not to replicate all WNTR features, but instead to provide a subset so that they can easily be used within QGIS. For accessing all features of WNTR the API can be used.

Notable missing features currently are:
* Water quality analysis is not possible
* Multiple demands per node is not possible
* The majority of options do not have a user interface

In addition, Shapefile support is limited (due to a limitation of attribute length to 254 characters)
